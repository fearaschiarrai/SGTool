# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=0.2.12 Fix loading of RGB tiffs on Linux
      * try again for autoload of libraries
      * refactor rte so it works like other FFT
      * recalc buffers so they are factors of powers of 2, 3 or 5 (should make large grid calcs faster)
      * add tooltips to explain dotpoint
      * add plugins.xml to allow direct access via plugin manager
      * Add 2D circular windowed spatial stats functions
      * Add DTM curvature classifier
      * Added Butterworth filter and scaler to DC filter
    0.2.11 Remove path insertion in worms code
      * add relief shading option (based on Grass algorithm)
      * generalise a bit epsg parsing for GRD
      * remove degree test for DirCos filter
      * Fix problem with toWkt() on Linux and maybe macs
      * Improved connectivity of worm polylines
      * Another attempt to fix RTP
      * Fix missing buffer for THG calc
      * Another attempt to fix RTE
      * Delete xml file when updating a grid
      * Autocheck boxes when parameter changed
    0.2.10 Bug fixes and GUI Update
      * GUI now split over 5 tabs
      * Add tool to produce outline polygon from a grid
      * Improved null handling in Normalise Grids tool
      * Remove unused joblib import
    0.2.9 Docked widget now adds in tabified mode if another widget already there
      * Reformulated RTP & RTE codes
      * Add grid outline tool
      * Add extra Utils tab to declutter GUI (for now!)
    0.2.8 Added Threshold to NaN tool
      * New conversion of worms to polyline shapefile option
      * New grid normalisation tool
      * New threshold to NaN tool      
      * Sun shading for 90 zenith reset to 88 as this can blow up otherwise
      * Better handling of irregular grids by using linear infill of NaNs
      * Checkboxes labels defined directly
      * GUI rearranged so gradient tools all together
      * Vertical Integration now uses user-defined buffer
    0.2.7 Add worming and improve installation of plugin on PC & Mac
    0.2.6 Add RGB conversion to grayscale
    0.2.5 2024-12-11
      * add convolution filtering
      * add simple gridding from csv and xyz format files
      * change to pyIGRF for RTP_E calcs
    0.2.3 2024-11-26
      * Bug fixes to Directional Cleaning
      * Change of behaviour: existing layer now overwritten in QGIS
      * Loading of GRD format optimised and now massively quicker
      * Check for unlikely lengths (>100) with geographic grids
    0.2.2 2024-11-25: Initial upload to plugin repository.
